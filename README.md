## Getting Started

There are two ways to install and use the App:

1. You can download it for free from Apple or Play Stores:

- Apple Store - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wannabe/id6446692315
- Play Store - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bartoszdadok.Wannabe

2. You can install Wannabe App locally on your phone.

### Local installation on your phone:

1. Clone the repo:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/BartoszDadok/WannabeFrontendApp.git
   ```

2. Install NPM packages:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Install the Expo App on your phone.
   Installing the Expo App is the simplest way to run Wannabe App locally on your phone.

- Apple Store - https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/expo-go/id982107779
- Play Store - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent

4. Open the cloned folder "WannabeFrontendApp" via Visual Studio Code.

5. Open the Visual Studio Code terminal and run this command:

   ```sh
   npm run tunnel
   ```

   After running this command you will see the QR Code. If you try to run this command via other terminals like Bash, QR Code can be not displayed. I recommend using Visual Studio Code terminal to do this.

6. Open the Expo app and scan the QR Code. After a while, Wannabe App will automatically open on your phone.

## Usage

The best part of the Wannabe App is that it features simple to understand answers.
For example, a very common question from a JavaScript interview is **What is the Callback Queue?**

Here is an example in dark mode:

This is a simple, but understandable detailed answer with animation. This is the main power of the Wannabe App.
